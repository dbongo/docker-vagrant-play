Getting Started
---------------

There are two options for running this project: 1) using docker with
boot2docker, or 2) using vagrant alone without boot2docker.

Prerequisites
-------------
The only prerequisite is Vagrant 1.6 installed on your host, assuming Mac OSX as the host environment.

Getting Started with Vagrant
----------------------------
Simply run vagrant up, then wait for the docker container to be built in the virtual machine.

Once the provisioning is done, and docker container is running in the
vm you should be able to run:

curl http://localhost:9400/api/timeofday

or:

curl -v -v 'localhost:9400/api/timeofday?timezone=PDT'


A successfull response will look like:
{"time":"June 16, 2014 7:14:07 AM PDT","timeIso":"2014-06-16T07:14:07.970-07:00"}


Building from scratch can be a bit slow, on the vm. Subsequent runs
will be speedy, but the initial build using the guest vm is slow when
running sbt, and re-downloading dependencies etc. Prebuilding on your
host vm is an option that makes the 'vagrant up' process much faster,
but be patient when you encounter the "Loading project definition from
/vagrant/project" message, it will complete, it just takes a while.
In order to make the build process faster, there is a check in the
Dockerfile for a pre-existing "build", if it exists, no sbt commands
are run on the guest vm.

If you decide to pre-build, just run:
sbt clean compile stage

Once the compile and stage commands are done, run:
vagrant up


Getting Started Without Vagrant(using docker and boot2docker)
-------------------------------------------------------------

The fastest way to get going on Mac OSX is to use boot2docker and
docker 1.0.  Using vagrant with the docker provider is very slow(and
not quite reliable, in my experience), and most of the time runs into
some problem.  However, using the latest docker 1.0, and boot2docker,
this workflow is fast and works reliably.


Example workflow with boot2docker:
# create a boot2docker vm with lots of memory, the default b2b vm has 1024MB, just too small to run a jvm.
boot2docker --memory=3072 init

# start the vm
boot2docker up

# build an image from Dockerfile
docker build -t evadnoob/time-in-timezone .

# run the built image
docker run -d -p 9000:9000 evadnoob/time-in-timezone

# get the ip
boot2docker ip

The VM's Host only interface IP address is: 192.168.59.105

# Example:
curl http://192.168.59.105:9000/api/timeofday
{"time":"June 15, 2014 12:07:28 PM EDT","timeIso":"2014-06-15T12:07:28.872-04:00"}%
